Topics to consider

* How to handle listing, language, class, subject, chapter and sections?
Like english, 8th, maths, mensuration etc. Do we have a model for this?
* How to store questions in multiple languages? For example, in mathematics,
questions can be created in english first and then translated to other languages.
Each version of assessment is tagged with a version and other languages need to
keep up with the english versions. Resources like images, formulas etc may be 
shared. Is it possible to use resource bundles?
* How to provide hints or pointed feedback?
